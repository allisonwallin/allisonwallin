### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Allison Wallin (she/her), and I am currently a PhD candidate in the department of Earth Science and Environmental Change at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. You can reach me at: awalli3@illinois.edu

My research focuses on wind and climate change. I am currently working on comparing a high-resolution observational station network of near-surface wind speed to reanalysis data in Illinois for the past 30 years to see how winds have been changing in the state and if the reanalysis data is an accurate representation of the station data.
