### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Allison Wallin (she/her), and I am currently a PhD candidate in the department of Earth Science and Environmental Change at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. You can reach me at: awalli3@illinois.edu

My research focuses on wind in different climate states. My projects are:

1. Recent Wind Stilling in Illinois: a comparison of observational weather station data and reanalysis data of 10 m wind speed and direction in Illinois (1992-2021) to assess the reliability of the reanalysis data and to quantify the variability and trends in wind

**Finished and submitted to the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology in December 2024

Station data: Illinois Climate Network, ASOS Network

Reanalysis data: ERA5, NASA MERRA-2, NCEP NARR

Repository: uiuc-ch1-ILwind

2. Global comparison of observational weather station data, reanalysis data, and CMIP6 models for near-surface wind speed and direction

3. Comparison of dune and loess proxy wind direction data to PMIP4 paleowind direction to assess changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation since the Last Glacial Maximum
